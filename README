In Go, you can explicitly specify how many processors a program will use. This number is set using the runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n) function from the runtime package, where n is the number of processors to be used.

By default, the value of runtime.GOMAXPROCS is set to the number of available processors on the machine where the program is executed.

usage:
1. execute
2. go tool trace trace.out
3. go to http://127.0.0.1:62289/trace
4.
